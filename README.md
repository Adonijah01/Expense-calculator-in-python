In this Expense Tracker app, you have the User class to represent a user with a username and password, and the Expense class to represent an expense with amount, category, description, and date.

The app allows users to register, login, and logout. Once logged in, they can add expenses, view their expenses, and exit the app. The user's data and expense history are stored internally in the app.

Remember to enhance the app further based on your requirements, such as adding more features like data analysis, budget setting, or data persistence. Additionally, you can improve the user interface by incorporating a graphical user interface (GUI) library like Tkinter or PyQt.

Feel free to modify and expand the code according to your specific needs and design guidelines.
